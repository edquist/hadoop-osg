  # The following needs to be removed once HDFS-1943 gets finally put to rest.

  # workaround HDFS-1943 (start as non-root). As soon as jsvc gets installed
  # we are assuming a secure installation and starting a data node as root.

  #    1. HADOOP_DATANODE_USER being set to root
  #    2. jsvc is installed but Hadoop is configures to run in an unsecure mode
